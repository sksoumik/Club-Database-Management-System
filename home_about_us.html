<h1>Purpose</h1>
<p>
	This project is mainly for the use of students and teachers. Whether you’re a fresher starting University or the Vice Chancellor of the University The Club management System project is supposed to aid Students and Teachers keep track of the Students Organizations and Clubs in almost most of the private and public universities of Bangladesh. <br/><br/>

Extra Curricular Activities such as joining a Students Club or Organization from early on in your college life can have a lot of benefits like learning leadership and getting to know about what’s happening around the country and world. And it is a good platform to socialize as well. <br/><br/>

The users can check out different Universities  from a different set of categories like Sports, Debate, Entertainment and look where they fit in the most. Before joining a club they can get to know about their activities like trips, past events, workshops, panel information etc. The club Manangement system helps you make your decision because life is too short to go with the wrong choices. 
Even teachers and officials can use it to find related info about executive members or Alumnis and connect with them. 
We also have an administrative login panel where an administrator can login and can append the database. He or She will be granted special priviledges which is later on discussed in this report.
